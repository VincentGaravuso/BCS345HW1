# BCS345HW1
BCS 345 Homework 1
Objectives: Write Java arithmetic expressions; Handle keyboard input and console output; Use
decision structure and repetition structures to solve application problems; Generate formatted output.

Tasks:
Create a new project called BCS345hw1 and use the default package for it. In the BCS345hw1.java,
write statements that perform the following two tasks:

Task 1
Assume a mobile phone service provider has three different service plans for its customers:
 Mobile Phone Service Plan
 Plan A: $39.99 per month. 450 free minutes. Additional usage costs $0.45 per minute.
 Plan B: $59.99 per month. 900 free minutes. Additional usage costs $0.40 per minute.
 Plan C: $69.99 per month. Unlimited minutes.
 
Write statements that calculate and display the customer’s monthly bill as well as display saving
information if the customer had used a different plan. The detailed tasks are as follows:
1) Display the above menu to the customer.
2) Prompt the user for his or her full name.
3) Ask which plan the customer has purchased. The program should accept lowercase or uppercase
letter of A, B, and C. If the customer enters any other letter, display an error message and ask the
customer to re-enter the plan name until a valid plan name is entered.
4) Ask how many minutes were used last month. The amount of minutes should be a non-negative
value, otherwise display an error message and ask the user to re-enter the value until a valid
number is entered.
5) Calculate the customer’s monthly charge.
6) Display the customer’s full name and monthly charge on the screen.
7) Display how much money the customer would save if he/she switches to other plans. If there
would be no savings by switching to other plans, display “You chose the best plan.”
The currency should be displayed with 2 decimal places as shown in the sample output.
Wherever possible, use named constants instead of numbers, for example, plan base cost, free minutes
for a plan, and additional minute cost. 

Task 2
In the same program, write a loop to display the 96 characters starting from the space character ‘ ’.
Display 16 characters on each line with one space between characters.
Sample output for Task 2:

 ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . /
 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ?
